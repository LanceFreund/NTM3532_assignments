   <section>
   <p class="color_change">The discography of Bastille, a British indie rock band, consists of one studio album, three extended plays, ten singles and eight music videos. Originally a solo project by Dan Smith, Bastille was formed in 2010. The band released its debut single "Flaws" / "Icarus" in July 2011 on the independent record label Young and Lost Club. An extended play titled Laura Palmer followed later that year. The critical success of the EP and extensive touring brought the group to the attention of Virgin Records, which signed them in December 2011.</p>

The band has released six singles from the album: "Overjoyed", "Bad Blood", "Flaws", "Pompeii", "Laura Palmer", "Things We Lost in the Fire", " with "Pompeii" peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart and topping the charts in Ireland and Scotland. On 14 October 2013, Pompeii reached number one on the US Billboard Alternative Songs chart and retained that position for the next four weeks.</p>
